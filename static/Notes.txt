what is dunder repr? (from the Model.py classes)
__repr__ is a special method in Python 
classes that is used to define a string representation of an object. 
It is called when the built-in repr() function is used on an object of the class, 
or when the object is output in an interactive session. 
The method should return a string that, when passed to the eval() function, 
would create an object that is equal to the original object. 
It is used to provide developers with a way to unambiguously identify an instance of a class.
