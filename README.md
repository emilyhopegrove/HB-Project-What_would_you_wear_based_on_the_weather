that it's actually quite chilly? Or vice versa? Here's the app for you.

## Features

Recommend a weather appropriate outfit based on the current weather conditions.

Option to select your preferred style of clothing, such as business casual or casual, sporty, or formal, 
favorite outfits, customized to your actual existing wardrobe, and a randomizer so you never wear the same clothes 2 days in a row. *

You'll even be able to be 'warm-blooded' or 'cold-blooded' so if you're the person who almost always wears shorts even when it's cold,or you wear jeans even in 100 degree weather, we've got you covered. *
